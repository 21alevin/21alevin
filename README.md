## Hi there 👋
Welcome! My name is Anna Levin and I am in my final year of my MS in Epidemiology at Temple University's Barnett College of Public Health. During the 2025 fall semester, I have been learning and working with ArcGIS Pro to create maps that address posed public health problems and with this website, I am sharing with you some of my best work from the course. 
Thank you for being here and please enjoy my work!

-Anna
